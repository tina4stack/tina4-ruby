# Changelog

Tina4 keeps ONE version across all four frameworks (Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js), so a version
number means the same thing everywhere.

**The authoritative release notes for every shipped version live in the documentation:**
https://tina4.com/ruby/36-releases

This file is deliberately NOT a copy of those notes. Duplicating them is exactly how a
changelog rots into claiming a version that was never cut, so this file records only
UNRELEASED work. When a version ships, its notes go to the release notes above.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Internal: the SQL dialect-translation file is renamed
  `lib/tina4/sql_translation.rb` -> `lib/tina4/sql_translator.rb`, so the filename matches the
  `Tina4::SQLTranslator` class it defines (and the sibling frameworks). The class name, its
  methods and its behaviour are unchanged, and `require "tina4"` is unaffected - this is a
  filename alignment, not an API change. Only code that bypassed the gem's own entry point with
  a direct `require "tina4/sql_translation"` needs to update the path.

### Fixed

- **`tina4 deploy docker` produced images that could not start.** Of the eight
  Dockerfile generators in the stack (four templates in the `tina4` CLI plus one
  in each framework's own CLI), exactly one was correct. Python named
  `python -m tina4_python.cli`, a package with no `__main__.py`, so the container
  died on startup; PHP ran `php index.php <addr>`, but `App::run(?host, port)`
  never reads argv so the address was dropped and production never engaged;
  Node named a path that exists only inside the tina4-nodejs monorepo and
  depended on tsx, which `npm ci --omit=dev` strips. Every generator now names a
  published entry point and requests production. Verified by scaffolding,
  generating, building and running a container for all four languages.
- **`serve` no longer kills PID 1.** The port-reclaim step read `lsof -ti`
  without validating it. Where lsof prints a different shape, a non-numeric field
  coerced to 0 or 1 -- and signalling PID 0 hits every process in the caller's
  own process group. In a container the server IS PID 1, so it killed itself
  (Node logged "Killed existing process on port 7148 (PID: 1 ...)" then exited
  143; PHP logged the same attempt and survived by luck). Reclaiming is now
  skipped inside a container, only all-digit PIDs are accepted, and PID 0, PID 1
  and the current process are never signalled.
- **The Ruby image builds.** The builder stage was `ruby:3.3-slim`, which has no
  compiler, so `bundle install` failed with `Gem::Ext::BuildError` on the first
  native extension (date, json, nio4r, sqlite3 are all in the default set). The
  builder is now the full `ruby:3.3` image and the slim runtime installs
  `libsqlite3-0`. Bundler's `deployment true` is gone: it demands a lockfile
  matching the image's bundler exactly, so a lockfile from a newer bundler on a
  developer machine hard-failed the build.

## Earlier history (pre-3.x)

Kept for reference only. The versions below are from the 0.x line, long before the unified
3.x versioning; everything from 3.x onward is in the release notes linked above.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Multi-stage Dockerfile (ruby:3.3-alpine, build + runtime stages, optimized layer caching)
- .dockerignore for clean Docker builds
- `tina4ruby init` now generates Dockerfile and .dockerignore alongside project scaffolding

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Zero-dependency GraphQL implementation (matching tina4php-graphql)
- Recursive descent GraphQL parser (queries, mutations, fragments, variables, aliases)
- Depth-first AST executor with resolver pattern
- GraphQL schema with programmatic type registration
- ORM auto-schema generation (`schema.from_orm(User)`) - auto-creates CRUD queries/mutations
- GraphiQL UI served at GET /graphql
- Route integration via `gql.register_route("/graphql")`
- Full GraphQL type system (scalars, objects, lists, non-null, input objects)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Default auth protection for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes (matching tina4_python behavior)
- API_KEY bypass in bearer auth - if `ENV["API_KEY"]` matches the bearer token, access is granted
- `auth: false` option to make write routes public (equivalent to tina4_python's `@noauth()`)
- `default_secure_auth` cached auth handler for performance
- `resolve_auth` helper for flexible auth resolution
- Puma as default production server (WEBrick fallback)
- `add_header` method on Response object

### Improved
- Performance: lazy-initialized Request fields (headers, body, params, cookies, files)
- Performance: pre-frozen CORS headers and OPTIONS response (zero allocation)
- Performance: method-indexed route lookup (O(1) method filtering)
- Performance: pre-computed static file roots at boot
- Performance: fast-path for API routes skipping static file checks
- Performance: cookie-less response fast path (no header duplication)
- Router: normalized path computed once per request instead of per-route
- Router: `match_path` returns params directly without redundant method check
- Response: frozen content-type constants
- Request: lazy `json_body` parsing
- RackApp: skip `auto_detect` when handler returns response object directly

### Changed
- GET routes remain public by default
- POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes are now secured by default (use `auth: false` to make public)
- `any` routes default to public (`auth: false`)
- `secure_*` variants now use `default_secure_auth` (cached lambda)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Core framework with Rack-based request pipeline
- DSL routing (get, post, put, patch, delete, any)
- Path parameters with type casting ({id:int}, {id:float}, {id:path})
- Route groups with shared auth handlers
- Request/Response objects with auto-type detection
- Puma production server (WEBrick fallback)
- SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Firebird database drivers
- Database abstraction with parameterized queries
- ORM with field types DSL and CRUD operations
- SQL migration runner
- JWT RS256 authentication + bcrypt password hashing
- File-based sessions with JWT tokens
- Before/after middleware hooks
- OpenAPI 3.0 Swagger auto-generation
- Twig-compatible template engine (ERB fallback)
- CRUD scaffolding
- REST API client helper
- WebSocket support
- Message queue abstraction (file, RabbitMQ, Kafka backends)
- SCSS auto-compilation
- Dev reload with file watching
- i18n localization
- Inline testing framework
- CLI commands (init, start, migrate, test)
- .env auto-creation and loading
- Colored debug logging with rotation
